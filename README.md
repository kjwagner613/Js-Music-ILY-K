Hello,
I am a beginner lerning this at 52 years old.  You can teach an old dog new tricks, and they will be good at it.

i have been in the tech industry since i was 17, so about 35 years experience in broadcasging, television, music recording, studio design, installatoin and integration, studio recoding,
just about every part under the sky if the project was going to the air. 

I find myself "between jobs" at this time, my last employer why by contract I am not allowed to mention told me after 10 of loyal and devoted employment, that they think it was a
good time for us to to our seperate ways.

Stumbling around a month I found these boot camps, so I am learning coding. Because 35 years of high-tech industry experience and being able to code should be a good thing, and hireable. Right?

So I am learning code and exploring my abilities as I continue to learn.

if you have any questions, insights or just want to vent, you can reach me at:

i do check it once in awhile. 

thanks and have a wonderful day
-K
