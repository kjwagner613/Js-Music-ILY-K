Hello,

I am a beginner learning this at 52 years old. You can teach an old dog new tricks, and they will be good at it.

I have been in the tech industry since I was 17, so I have about 35 years of experience in broadcasting, television, music recording, studio design, installation and integration, studio recordingâ€”just about every part under the sky if the project was going to air.

I find myself "between jobs" at this time. My last employer, whom I am not allowed to mention by contract, told me after 10 years of loyal and devoted employment that they thought it was a good time for us to go our separate ways.

After stumbling around for a month, I found these boot camps and started learning coding. With 35 years of high-tech industry experience, being able to code should be a good thing and make me hireable, right?

So, I am learning code and exploring my abilities as I continue to learn.

If you have any questions, insights, or just want to vent, you can reach me at:

I do check it once in a while.

Thanks, and have a wonderful day,

-K
